            <p> By the 11th century, people lived in systemically aligned housing, buried their dead, and manufactured copper ornaments and black and red pottery.[50] The Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers were natural arteries for communication and transportation,[50] and estuaries on the Bay of Bengal permitted maritime trade</p>
            <p>, Bengali crystallized as an official court language, giving rise to various prominent writers. The sultanate was evolving as a commercialized and monetized economy and as a melting pot of Muslim political, mercantile and military elites</p>
